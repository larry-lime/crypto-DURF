# DURF Project Overview

## Research Question

What is the most widely adopted investment approach institutional investors are using to profit off crypto assets? And what is the methodology behind it?

## Ultimate Goal

The primary goal of our project is to educate curious learners about the methods institutional investors are using to profit in the Web3 world. We also take a deep technical dive into two methods of project valuation, giving learners a fundamental understanding of the processes involved in crypto asset risk assessment and valuation.
